## ‚öô Installation
Before downloading the project, you'll need to install the following parts 
### RASA Python
RASA can be installed using the package manager pip using Python
```bash
pip3 install rasa
```
### Flutter
Flutter, an open-source framework by Google for building natively compiled multi-platform applications from a single codebase. <br> You can download Flutter from <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">here</a>.
Flutter is based on the <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart programming language, </a>, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with Dart's syntax.

### Firebase
Firebase serves as the backend server for the mobile app and provides a database. To set it up, I recommend following Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios">documentation</a> for proper guidance.

## ü§ñ Technial shenanigans
